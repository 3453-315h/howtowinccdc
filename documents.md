# CCDC Historical Documents

One of the best ways to learn and prepare for an event is to read up on all of it's history. Even if you don't compete in a specific region, learning how they prepare or recommendations they make could add that extra edge.

Here are team packets, rules and other documents put out by each region and nationals for learning and archiving: [https://github.com/mubix/howtowinccdc/tree/master/documents](https://github.com/mubix/howtowinccdc/tree/master/documents)

If you happen to have received any of these documents or know where to get them, please contribute them to the repository.

Thank you!
